interaction design lab (to-not-do)
==================================

- get lab logo stickers printed
- display recent papers' first pages in lab windows
- mount old iphones to window (1?) and walls to display slideshows of
  current/recent projects
- set up wake-on-lan for my server... people keep turning it off or the power
  goes out!
- review and update auto-backup procedures for dev server's databases
- readings from pinch's 6321 'inside technology' class
- clean up cornellhci.org?
- learn to write a modern wordpress skin (it's been years) with the lab website?
- make t-shirts with IDL neologisms (e.g. Eric's "designerality")
