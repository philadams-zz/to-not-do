random questions (to-not-do)
============================

- what happens to social network accounts when people die? (this is now a 3+
  year-old idea as of 2013; and brubaker has literally written the book on it
  since)
- something intersecting eric's framing work and granka's search diversity
- one space / two spaces post-period in writing and typography: what's the deal?
- how time is conceptualized re phones / modernity

  - analog to space reconceptualizing thanks to gmaps etc.
  - s tv does with languages, are various time languages/accents becoming extinct?
  - c.f. eric's blog readership and kairotic time work
